# FaunaDB Demo App

This is a demo application which showcases how to create a simple CRUD REST service backed by FaunaDB. The examples presented in the [Getting Started](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/gettingstarted) and [CRUD](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/howto/crud) guides have been used as starting point for implementing the service.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Setup a Fauna Cloud account
Create a Fauna Cloud account filling the form [here](https://app.fauna.com/sign-up).


### 2. Install Fauna Shell
Open a terminal and install the Fauna Shell.  If you are on a PC, you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):

```
$ npm install -g fauna-shell
```

Alternatively, if you are on a Mac, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
$ brew install fauna-shell
```


### 3. Create Database
Next, create a new database to which the application will connect to for storing the data. For doing so, login to your Fauna Cloud account from the Fauna Shell by typing the following command:

```
$ fauna cloud-login
```

It will prompt for your Fauna Cloud credentials, where you need to enter the email you used for signing up, and your password.

```
Email: email@example.com
Password: **********
```

> Note: once you are logged in on a machine, the Fauna Shell will remember your credentials so you donâ€™t need to log in again.

The next step will be to create the database. Issue the following command for creating a database called `demo-app`:


```
$ fauna create-database demo-app
```


### 4. Set up Schema

Run below command for creating the DB schema. It will execute all required queries from a file.

```
$ fauna run-queries demo-app --file=./scripts/create_schema.fql
```

### 5. Obtain an API Key
Next, issue an API Key for connecting to the new created DB from the service. Execute below command for doing so:

```
$ fauna create-key demo-app server
```

Make sure to write down the given secret key. It will be used for starting up the service later on.

> Alternatively, you can also create an API Key from the Cloud Dashboard [here](https://dashboard.fauna.com/db/demo-app/keys).

## Running the app

For starting up the service you can use all `sbt` standard commands. If you don't have `sbt` installed, follow instructions [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

Before runnning the service, make sure to include the API key created above as follows:

```
$ sbt run -Dfauna-db.secret=your_api_key_goes_here
```

The app will start by default at port `9000`.

## FQL Reference

The persistence layer has been modeled after Domain-Driven Design Repository pattern. 

> __A word on the Repository pattern...__
> 
> Unlike DAOs, which are designed following a data access orientation, Repositories are implemented following a collection orientation. This means that their interface will mimic the one of a collection of objects rather than exposing a set of CRUD operations. The focus is put this way on the domain as a model rather than on data and any CRUD operations that may be used behind the scenes to manage the actual persistence.

### Save a Post
If there's no previous Post for the given Id, it creates a new Post using an autogenerated Id and the given data. If there's a Post for the given Id, it replaces its content with the given data.

```scala
Select(
  "data",
  If(
    Exists(Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873")),
    Replace(
      Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873"), 
      Obj("data" -> Obj("title" -> "My cat and other marvels")))
    )
    Create(
      Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873"), 
      Obj("data" -> Obj("title" -> "My cat and other marvels"))))
    )
  )  
)
```

### Save several Posts
It saves several Posts within a single transaction. It uses the `Map` function to iterate over a collection of entities and apply the above save query to them.

```scala
Map(
  Arr(Obj("data" -> Obj("title" -> "My cat and other marvels")))),
  Lambda( nextEntity => 
    //-- Save Query goes here
  )
```

* [Lambda](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/reference/queryapi#lambda)

### Find a Post
It looks up a Post by its Id and returns its data back. 

```scala
Select(
  "data", 
  Get(Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873"))
)
```
#### References:
* [Select](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/reference/queryapi#select)
* [Get](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/reference/queryapi#get)


### Find all Posts
It looks up all Posts in the class and returns its data back. First, all Posts Ids are found using the class `Index` together with the `Paginate` function and then its data is looked up through the `Get` function.

```scala

SelectAll(
  "data",
  Map(
    Paginate(Match(Index("all_posts"))),
    Lambda( nextRef => 
      Select("data", Get(nextRef)))
  )
)
```

* [Lambda](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/reference/queryapi#lambda)
* [Get](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/reference/queryapi#get)

### Find Posts by Title
It looks up all Posts matching the given Title and returns its data. The search is done using a previsouly created `Index`.  First, all Posts Ids are found using the `Index` together with the `Paginate` function and then its data is looked up through the `Get` function.

```scala
SelectAll(
  "data",
  Map(
    Paginate(Match(Index(posts_by_title)), "My cat and other marvels"),
    Lambda( nextRef => 
      Select("data", Get(nextRef)))
  )
)
```

### Remove a Post
It removes the Post for the given Id if any and returns its data.

  Delete(Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873"))
)
```
