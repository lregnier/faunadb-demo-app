# FaunaDB Demo App

This is a demo application which showcases how to create a simple CRUD REST service backed by FaunaDB. The examples presented in the [Getting Started](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/gettingstarted) and [CRUD](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/howto/crud) guides have been used as starting point for implementing the service.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Setup a Fauna Cloud account
Create a Fauna Cloud account filling the form [here](https://app.fauna.com/sign-up).


### 2. Install Fauna Shell
Open a terminal and install the Fauna Shell.  If you are on a PC, you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):

```
$ npm install -g fauna-shell
```

Alternatively, if you are on a Mac, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
$ brew install fauna-shell
```


### 3. Create Database
Once the Fauna Shell is installed, it’s time to login to your Fauna Cloud account from the shell. You can do that by typing the following command:

```
$ fauna cloud-login
```

It will prompt for your Fauna Cloud credentials, where you need to enter the email you used for signing up, and your password.

```
Email: email@example.com
Password: **********
```

> Note: once you are logged in on a machine, the Fauna Shell will remember your credentials so you don’t need to log in again.

The next step will be to create a database for storing the data. Issue the following command for creating a database called `demo-app`:


```
$ fauna create-database demo-app
```


### 4. Set up Schema

Run below command for creating the DB schema. It will execute all required queries from a file.

```
fauna run-queries demo-app --file=./scripts/create_schema.fql
```

### 5. Obtain an API Key for the DB
Create an API Key for the created DB from the Cloud Dashboard [here](https://dashboard.fauna.com/db/demo-app/keys). The API key will be used for running the service.


## Running the app

For running the service, make sure to include the Admin API key created above as follows:

```
sbt run -Dfauna-db.secret=your_api_key_goes_here
```

The app will start by default at port `9000`.

## FQL Reference

The persistence layer has been modeled after Domain-Driven Design Repository pattern. 

> __A word on the Repository pattern...__
> 
> Unlike DAOs, which are designed following a data access orientation, Repositories are implemented following a collection orientation. This means that their interface will mimic the one of a collection of objects rather than exposing a set of CRUD operations. The focus is put this way on the domain as a model rather than on data and any CRUD operations that may be used behind the scenes to manage the actual persistence.

### Save a Post
If there's no previous Post for the given Id, it creates a new Post using an autogenerated Id and the given data. If there's a Post for the given Id, it replaces its content with the given data.

```scala
Select(
  "data",
  If(
    Exists(Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873")),
    Replace(
      Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873"), 
      Obj("data" -> Obj("title" -> "My cat and other marvels")))
    )
    Create(
      Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873"), 
      Obj("data" -> Obj("title" -> "My cat and other marvels"))))
    )
  )  
)
```

### Save several Posts
It saves several Posts within a single transaction. It uses the `Map` function to iterate over a collection of entities and apply the above save query to them.

```scala
Map(
  Arr(Obj("data" -> Obj("title" -> "My cat and other marvels")))),
  Lambda( nextEntity => 
    //-- Save Query goes here
  )
```

### Find a Post
It looks up a Post by its Id and returns its data back. 

```scala
Select(
  "data", 
  Get(Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873"))
)
```

* [Get](https://app.fauna.com/documentation/reference/queryapi#get)


### Find all Posts
It looks up all Posts in the class and returns its data back. First, all Posts Ids are found using the class `Index` together with the `Paginate` function and then its data is looked up through the `Get` function.

```scala

SelectAll(
  "data",
  Map(
    Paginate(Match(Index("all_posts"))),
    Lambda( nextRef => 
      Select("data", Get(nextRef)))
  )
)
```

### Find Posts by Title
It looks up all Posts matching the given Title and returns its data. The search is done using a previsouly created `Index`.  First, all Posts Ids are found using the `Index` together with the `Paginate` function and then its data is looked up through the `Get` function.

```scala
SelectAll(
  "data",
  Map(
    Paginate(Match(Index(posts_by_title)), "My cat and other marvels"),
    Lambda( nextRef => 
      Select("data", Get(nextRef)))
  )
)
```

### Remove a Post
It removes the Post for the given Id if any and returns its data.

```scala
Select(
  "data",
  Delete(Ref(Class("posts"), "1520225686617873"))
)
```
